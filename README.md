"Lush" Website Design
=================

A web template designed with HTML, CSS, and PHP.

I was going for a simplistic, nature look, while keeping it appealing to the eyes. 
“Lorem ipsum” place-holder text was used as placeholder text to demonstrate the design 
better. The CAPTCHA on the contact form was provided by Securimage. The list of programs 
seen in the bottom panel is a sample of programs that I’ve created for practice/as side-project, 
most of which are in Visual Basic .NET and/or Java, with conversions to other languages on my 
list of things to do. HTML and CSS were used to create the theme itself, while PHP’s include 
function was used to make the header, footer and navigation manageable from one file (plus the 
files containing the header/footer/navigation themselves). PHP is also used to load pages via
URL parameters. For example, to load the ‘contact’ page, all that is needed is a file named 
‘contact’ (containing the page’s content, which is loaded into the main content area – the 
lighter white area), and a link to www.example.com/?page=contact. Notepad++ was used to put 
everything together. The site renders well in all popular modern browsers.
